.SH NAME
wvdialconf \- build a configuration file for
.BR wvdial (1)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wvdialconf
.I /etc/wvdial.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wvdialconf
detects your modem, its maximum baud rate, and a good initialization
string and generates or updates the
.BR wvdial (1)
configuration file based on this information.
.PP
.B wvdialconf
is completely non-interactive.  You still need to edit
.I /etc/wvdial.conf
to specify the phone number, login name, and password of your internet
account in order for
.BR wvdial (1)
to work.
.PP
It is safe to run
.B wvdialconf
if a configuration file already exists.  In that case, only the
.IR Modem ,
.IR Baud ,
.IR Init ,
and
.I Init2
options are changed in the
.I "[Dialer Defaults]"
section, and only if autodetection is successful.

.SH BUGS
We're willing to entertain the possibility.  Let us know if you have any
problems by sending an e-mail to
.BR <wvdial@nit.ca> .
.PP
Also, there is now a mailing list for discussion about
.BR wvdial .
If you are having problems, or have anything else to say, send e-mail to
.BR <wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca> .

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

An exit status of 0 means that a modem was detected and the
configuration file was updated successfully.

Any other value means
that something went wrong and the configuration file was unchanged.

.SH AUTHORS
